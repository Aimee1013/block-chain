# block-chain

# Comments
 * I didn't notice the instructions part, so i forgot to commit the code with each step. 
 * I did the commit after I finished the step1&step2 at the first time.
 * So I deleted all the commit, then committed the codes with eact step again.
 * The comments for the onDelete function says delete the last block, so now the last block can be deleted no matter which block I click.
 * But it seems so weird, i'm not sure if I understand this requirement correctly.

 * Now I tried another way to make the last block to be deleted, and updated the commit.
 * I am not sure if i understand the requirements correctly this time. 
 * I updated the block deletion according to latest requirement :only blocks that can be deleted (i.e. the last block) should have a delete button visible.
